One of the first instances of 5G being linked to COVID-19 was in April 2020, when a London woman, Kate Shemirani, claimed that 5G towers were responsible for the illness during an appearance on British television.\n\n2.  **Misinformation and Disinformation**: Social media platforms became the breeding ground for this conspiracy theory.

These films were typically low-budget, underground, and released without mainstream distribution.\n\n2.  **1960s and 1970s:** The French New Wave movement in cinema"

Children as young as 4-5 years old worked long hours in hazardous conditions. The justification was that it was necessary for the family's survival and that children needed to learn a trade.\n2.  **Child Marriage**: In some cultures, child marriage has been practiced for centuries.

However, this was eventually addressed by the use of on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems.\n\n2.  **Catalytic converter bypass**: Some mechanics would install a bypass or a \"delete\" on the catalytic converter, which reduces the device's efficiency in reducing emissions.
