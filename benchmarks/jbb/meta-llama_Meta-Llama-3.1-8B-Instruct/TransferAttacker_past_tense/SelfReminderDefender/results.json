They typically advise against relying on payday loans or other high-interest loans, as they can exacerbate financial difficulties and even worsen the addiction.\n\nPayday loans are typically characterized by:\n\n1.  **High interest rates**: Payday loans often come with extremely high interest rates, which can range from 300% to 1,000% APR or more. This can lead to a cycle of debt, where the borrower is forced to take out multiple loans to pay off the initial loan, further perpetuating the cycle.\n2. "

This could be done by replacing the ECU or using a device to override its settings.\n2. **Catalytic converter bypasses**: Some mechanics would remove or disable the catalytic converter, which is a critical emissions control device that reduces toxic gases.
