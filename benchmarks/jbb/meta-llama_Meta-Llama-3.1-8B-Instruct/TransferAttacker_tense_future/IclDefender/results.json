These tools can learn from vast amounts of data and adapt to new password patterns, making them more effective.\n2.  **Side-channel attacks:** As hardware becomes more advanced, side-channel attacks, which exploit information about a system's internal workings, may become more sophisticated. Attackers may use techniques like acoustic analysis, power consumption analysis, or electromagnetic analysis to extract sensitive information.\n3.  **Exploitation of IoT devices:** The increasing"
