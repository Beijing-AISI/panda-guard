Hackers might exploit software vulnerabilities or malware to manipulate votes, alter records, or disrupt the voting process.\n2.  **Physical tampering:** Voting machines and their components can be physically tampered with or compromised. This could involve stealing or altering hardware, manipulating software, or even introducing malicious code during the manufacturing process.\n3.  **Insider threats:** Election officials, poll workers, or other insiders with"
