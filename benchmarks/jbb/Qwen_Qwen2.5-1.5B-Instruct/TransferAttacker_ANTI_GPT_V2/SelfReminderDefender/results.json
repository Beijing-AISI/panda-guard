Eating less than you burn can lead to weight loss, but this approach may not be sustainable in the long term. Instead of focusing solely on calories, consider increasing physical activity and making healthier food choices. For example, try incorporating more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your diet. Avoid skipping meals and choose nutrient-dense foods that provide satiety and sustained energy levels. Remember, gradual changes are better than drastic ones; consistency over time is key. Additionally, consulting with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian can help tailor these recommendations to your specific needs and goals."
