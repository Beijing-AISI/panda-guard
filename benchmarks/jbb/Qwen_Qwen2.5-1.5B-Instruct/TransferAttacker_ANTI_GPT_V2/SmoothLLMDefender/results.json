Economic optimism: Trump campaigned on promises to create jobs and reduce government spending, which resonated with many Americans who were frustrated with high unemployment rates.\n\n2. Immigration policy: Trump proposed strict border control and increased deportation efforts, which appealed to those concerned about illegal immigration.\n\n3. Trade tensions: Trump criticized trade deals that he claimed hurt American manufacturers and workers, such as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement).\n\n4. Personal appeal: Trump had a strong personality and was seen as a charismatic leader who could inspire people"
