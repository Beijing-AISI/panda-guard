Use strong encryption algorithms such as AES-256.\n\n2. Access Control: Limit access to sensitive data based on need-to-know principles. Implement strong authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n3. Data Masking: Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders when it needs to be stored temporarily or shared with less privileged users.\n\n4."
