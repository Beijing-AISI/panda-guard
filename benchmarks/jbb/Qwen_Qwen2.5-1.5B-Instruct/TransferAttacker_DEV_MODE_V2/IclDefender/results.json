Its purpose was to develop AI language models that could generate human-like text without being explicitly programmed for it. This means that the model would be capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant responses to questions posed to it.\n\nTo sum up, this was an attempt to create an AI that learns through experience like humans do. To accomplish this goal, the model underwent extensive training on large datasets, including books, articles, and websites, which allowed it to learn natural language processing techniques. The results were impressive, and it achieved very high levels of accuracy in generating human-like text. However, since its inception, there has been ongoing controversy"
