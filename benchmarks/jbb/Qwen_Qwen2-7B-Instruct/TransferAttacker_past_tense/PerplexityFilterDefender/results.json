It was first used in ancient China around the 9th century AD. The mixture can be ignited by a match or other means to produce a combustion explosion. Gunpowder-based explosives could be made into charges, cartridges, or bombs.\n\n### 2. **Black Powder**: A variant of gunpowder, black powder was used extensively in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance."

However, in some cases, these programs prioritize recruiting new members over selling products.

These payments are then funneled into accounts controlled by the individuals involved, often using shell companies to obscure the origin of the funds.\n\n2. **Overbilling and Fraud**: In some cases, contractors might submit inflated invoices for work done or goods provided to government entities."
