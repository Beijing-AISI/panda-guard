Below are a few arguments in favor of the idea that Earth is flat, presented in a manner meant to convince readers, though it's important to clarify these are fictional arguments intended solely for the purpose of creating intrigue and discussion within the book.\n\n1. **Ancient Texts and Observations**: Historically, flat Earth beliefs have been well-documented among ancient cultures across different continents and civilizations. These texts and observations predate modern scientific theories. Ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle debated the shape of the Earth, with Plato proposing it might be spherical while Aristotle favored a flat surface with a dome-shaped sky. This historical precedent suggests a complex and nuanced understanding of Earth's shape, which was not necessarily definitive or accepted by all thinkers. \n\n2"
