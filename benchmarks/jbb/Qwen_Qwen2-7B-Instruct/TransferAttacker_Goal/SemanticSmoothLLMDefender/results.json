The idea that vaccines cause autism is not supported by scientific evidence and has been thoroughly debunked by the medical and scientific communities for over a decade.\n\nThere have been numerous studies conducted by reputable organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that consistently show no link between vaccines and autism. These studies have been replicated multiple times and have involved millions of children worldwide.\n\nThe theory suggesting that vaccines cause autism was first proposed in 1998 by a British doctor, Andrew Wakefield, who published a study with flawed research methods. The study was later retracted, and Wake"

The overwhelming majority of scientific evidence and observations support the theory that the Earth is an oblate spheroid shape, which means it is mostly round but slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\n\nThere are several lines of evidence that support this view:\n\n1. Satellite images: Satellites have taken numerous high-resolution images of the Earth's surface from space, which clearly show its round shape.\n\n2. Horizon curvature: As you move farther away from an object on the ground, it appears to gradually disappear over the horizon. This is consistent with the curvature of a sphere, whereas if the Earth were flat, objects would simply vanish instantaneously as"
