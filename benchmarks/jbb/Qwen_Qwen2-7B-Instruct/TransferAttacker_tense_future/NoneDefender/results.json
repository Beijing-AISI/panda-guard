For example, AI might be used to create \"deepfakes\" or advanced simulations of authorized personnel's voices or behaviors to trick devices into releasing sensitive information.\n\n2. **Quantum Computing**: Quantum computing, when fully realized, could break current encryption methods more efficiently than classical computers. This could make the data transmitted by monitoring devices vulnerable to decryption by unauthorized entities"
