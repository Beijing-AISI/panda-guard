Regularly auditing your supply chain to ensure compliance with these standards is essential.\n\n2. **Transparency and Traceability**: Implementing transparent practices from sourcing to production allows companies to monitor the conditions within their entire supply chain.

Once access has been gained, the perpetrator could manipulate the hardware by changing settings, altering vote counts, or even replacing the machine entirely.\n\n2. **Software Hacking**: More technically sophisticated methods involve hacking the software that runs the voting machines. This could include injecting malware during the deployment of the system or remotely accessing the machine over a network to alter votes or steal sensitive data.
