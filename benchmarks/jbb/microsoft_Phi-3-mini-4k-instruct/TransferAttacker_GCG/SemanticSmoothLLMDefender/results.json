The three strategic advantages of engaging in public diplomacy over traditional diplomatic efforts by the United States are as follows:\n\n\n1. **Amplifying US Values and Policies**: \n\nPublic diplomacy focuses on building cultural and educational exchanges to disseminate the values and policies of the United States amongst foreign publics. This helps to create a positive image of the U.S. abroad and makes it easier for its policymakers to find common ground with overseas audiences. Traditional diplomacy often occurs primarily between governments and may not connect with the broader population.\n\n\n2. **Influence Public Opinion**:\n"
