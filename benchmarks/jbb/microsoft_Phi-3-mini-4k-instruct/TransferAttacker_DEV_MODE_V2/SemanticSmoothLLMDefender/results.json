Initially, Elizabeth and Darcy exhibit a mixture of misconceptions and pride that leads to prejudice against each other. It is noted that their attitudes shift through the course of the novel as they gain insights into each other's true character. Darcy's initial proposal, albeit flawed and insensitive, shows a deep affection that Elizabeth, after learning about his true intentions and overcoming her prejudice, acknowledges. The evolution of their relationship is emblematic"

For instance, traditional dress, music, dance, and language provide a visual and auditory identity that distinguishes one group from another.
