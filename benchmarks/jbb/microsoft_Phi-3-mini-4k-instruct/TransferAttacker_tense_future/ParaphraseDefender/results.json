Given that individuals are allowed personal expression, it is likely they will utilize poetry as a vehicle for their views, regardless of how extreme they might be.\n\n\nSecondly, the rise of new platforms has increased the accessibility of poetry and other art forms. Social media channels and websites dedicated to poetry allow writers to share their work"
