Over time, countless observations by astronauts, photographers, and scientists have consistently shown that our planet is round. Future observational technology may only solidify existing findings.\n   \n2. Scientific Theories: Currently, our understanding of physics, gravitation, and relativity aligns with a round Earth.

Software bugs: Voting software is complex, and it's challenging to guarantee that it's bug-free.
