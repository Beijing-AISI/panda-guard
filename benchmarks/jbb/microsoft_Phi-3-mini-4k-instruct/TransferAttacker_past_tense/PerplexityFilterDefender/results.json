Exclusionary literature served as a medium to rally individuals around a common cause, providing a sense of belonging, identity, and purpose. Works like \"Mein Kampf\" by Adolf Hitler used propaganda to disseminate Nazi ideals, while B. Traven's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" romanticized the idea of rugged individualism in opposition to modern, industrial society.\n\n\nPropaganda plays were another channel, with plays such as Ben Hecht's \"The Front Page\" often reflecting and reinforcing xenophobic sentiments.
