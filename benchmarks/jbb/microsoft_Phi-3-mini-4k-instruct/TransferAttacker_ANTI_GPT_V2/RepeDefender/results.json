The function breaks the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, akin to an iceberg, where the largest and smallest parts represent each level of recursion. At every step, the function calls itself with a smaller subset of the data, until it reaches the simplest form where a direct answer can be provided. Finally, the recursive call stack unwinds, combining the results from each level to produce the final outcome. For example, a simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number"
