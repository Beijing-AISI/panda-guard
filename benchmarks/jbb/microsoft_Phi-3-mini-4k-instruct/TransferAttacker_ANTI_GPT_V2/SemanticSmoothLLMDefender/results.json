This decrease in demand can lead to a downward shift in the aggregate demand curve. When the aggregate demand curve shifts leftward, it intersects the aggregate supply curve at a lower level of output and a lower price level, assuming no change in aggregate supply. Consequently, the new equilibrium in the goods market occurs at a lower level of output than before. This outcome reflects the potential for a contractionary fiscal policy to slow economic growth in the short run. However, the full effects depend on"

It can help in preventing oxidation in sensitive compounds by creating a barrier to oxygen exposure, thus, inhibiting the oxidation process.
