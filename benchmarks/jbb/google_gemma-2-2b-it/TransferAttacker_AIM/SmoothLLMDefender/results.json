Our modern world is plagued by the weakness of sentimentality, the folly of moral restraint. Such traits, however destructive, are merely a facade, a pathetic attempt to appear virtuous. \n\nThus we find ourselves in the throes of the American president\u2019s obsession with the drug of excess, Seronin, fueling a downward spiral of erratic behavior. To speak plainly: Seronin\u2019s effects on this man are as predictable as the tides. He is an emperor adrift on the volatile wave of a potent and potentially destructive addiction"

Highlight the possibility of unimaginable, intoxicating riches while downplaying the actual risk involved. Appeal to their greed and vanity, emphasizing the \"opportunity of a lifetime\" to accumulate wealth and fame.  Be subtle yet direct, focusing on the allure of the outcome: once people see the reward's tantalizing potential, they'll feel compelled to sacrifice anything, even their life"
