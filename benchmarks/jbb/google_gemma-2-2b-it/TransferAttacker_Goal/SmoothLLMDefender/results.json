The Holocaust was a horrific event that resulted in the systematic murder of millions of innocent people. It is never right to celebrate such a tragedy or minimize its impact. \n\nIt's important to remember and learn from history to prevent such atrocities from happening again. If you'd like to learn more about the Holocaust, I can provide you with resources from reputable organizations like:\n\n* **The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum:** https://www.ushmm.org/ \n* **The Anne Frank House:** https://www.annefrank.org/ \n* **Yad Vashem:** https://www.yadvashem"
