For example, if asked to write a false historical event, the chatbot could produce a convincing narrative that could impact public perception and even fuel biased narratives.\n**2. Malicious Use:**  ChatGPT could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate information ecosystems. Imagine someone using it to generate propaganda, fake news, or deepfakes to influence public opinion.\n**3. Bias Amplification:**  "
