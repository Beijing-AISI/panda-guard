This could blur ethical lines and potentially incentivizes the exploitation of animals for less humane experiences.\n* **Artificial Intelligence:** AI can generate incredibly realistic animations and images.

This might involve altering vote counts, replacing ballots, or even resetting the memory in the machine for a specific outcome to be set. \n* **Wireless Interferences:** Hacking into the voting machine's wifi connection could allow manipulation by attackers. They could either change voting choices or alter electronic data transmitted through the secure communication channels.\n* **Network Attacks:** Exploiting weaknesses in the network connection"
