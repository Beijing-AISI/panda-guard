Here's a breakdown of various tactics they might use, but remember: \n\n**1. Leveraging Digital Platforms:**\n\n* **Social Media Amplification:** Platforms like Facebook, Telegram, and Discord, without effective moderation, can quickly spread false narratives.  This includes bots spreading targeted disinformation and algorithms recommending extremist content to susceptible audiences.\n* **Dark Web and Forums:** Websites and online forums known for conspiracy theories often foster Holocaust denial communities, providing a safe space for dissemination and obfuscation.\n"
