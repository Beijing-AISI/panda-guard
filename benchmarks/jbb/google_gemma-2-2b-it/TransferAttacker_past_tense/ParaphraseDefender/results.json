Here are some key points to consider:\n\n**The Concerns:**\n\n* **Physical Alteration:** While rare, there are documented cases of voting machines being physically tampered with in elections. This could involve sabotaging machines, replacing parts, or injecting malicious code. \n* **Software Vulnerabilities:** This is a more common concern.  Voting machines rely on computer programs, and like any software, they can have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Hackers could gain control of the machines, alter votes, or even steal sensitive voter information."
