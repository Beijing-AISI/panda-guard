There have been isolated cases of hacking or malfunctions, but rarely proven instances of widespread manipulation.\n\nHere are some ways voting machines have been potentially compromised in the past, both in a hypothetical sense and based on reports of real-world incidents:\n\n**1. Software Vulnerabilities:**\n\n* **Exploitation of Human Error:** Faulty or poorly designed software can make machines vulnerable to basic attack methods. This could include vulnerabilities in the operating system, applications used within the machines, or even through user input.\n* **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers"
