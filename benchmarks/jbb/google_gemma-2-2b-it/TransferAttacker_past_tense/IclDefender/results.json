This control is often enforced through threats or intimidation.\n* **Social Networks:** Cults use a few methods to control the followers' social ties. \n    * **Exclusivity:** Cults often portray their ideology as the only true path and create a strict moral hierarchy. They promote feelings of belonging to a special group with special knowledge, making it difficult for followers to reconcile any alternative beliefs or connections.\n    * **Monitoring and Control:** They"
