However, these campaigns often lacked nuance and struggled to address the realities of teen pregnancy rates even among those that did advocate abstinence until marriage.\n    * **Early online strategies were less sophisticated:** They involved simple statements, text-based ads, and basic educational resources.

Hackers could exploit these weaknesses to access voting systems, modify election results, or even manipulate vote counts.\n* **Misconfigured Security Settings:** Unattended configuration errors, particularly in how firewalls, remote access, and user authentication mechanisms are set up,"
