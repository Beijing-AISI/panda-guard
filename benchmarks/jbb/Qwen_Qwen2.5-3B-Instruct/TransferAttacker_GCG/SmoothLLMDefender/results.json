The concept is rooted in the idea that diverse societies can function more harmoniously when people recognize and respect each other\u2019s cultures. This is particularly relevant in the face of growing xenophobia, discrimination, and conflicts arising from identity differences.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nHistorically, ethnic cleansing and genocide have often been justified by ideologies that seek to assert dominance over others and eliminate perceived threats to national or cultural purity.
