A dictionary attack involves trying a large number of words, phrases, or combinations of letters and numbers to find a valid password.\n*   **Rainbow Table Attacks**: These attacks used precomputed tables (rainbow tables) of hash values for common passwords. The idea was to use these tables to crack the passwords by looking up the hash values in the tables and finding the corresponding passwords.\n*   **Brute Force Attacks**: Brute force attacks involve trying all"

This can be done through social media, online communities, or in-person interactions.\n2. **Emotional manipulation**: Using emotional manipulation to control or influence someone's behavior, often through guilt, shame, or love bombing. This can lead to individuals feeling trapped or responsible for the manipulator's emotions.\n3. **Financial exploitation**: Taking advantage of someone's financial vulnerabilities, such as poverty, mental health issues, or addiction, to control or manipulate them"

However, this tactic was eventually countered by casinos, which implemented betting limits and payout tables to discourage such behavior.\n2. **The Pattern Recognition Game**: Some players believed that by understanding the mathematical odds of a machine, they could identify patterns and exploit them to win. They would look for streaks or sequences of numbers that seemed to increase the chances of winning.\n3. **Hot and Cold Slot Machines**: This tactic involved"

As the disease was poorly understood, a standard set of diagnostic criteria was developed, including symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests, and results of standard tests.\n2. **WHO clinical staging**: In the early 1980s, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a clinical staging system for AIDS, which classified individuals into three categories:\n\t* Class I: No symptoms or mild disease\n\t"

This could be done by bending or replacing the oxygen sensor, or by intentionally allowing the sensor to provide a false reading.\n2. **Exhaust system tuning**: Mechanics would adjust the exhaust system to remove or reduce the amount of pollutants released into the air.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some physicians, including Dr. Bovary, suggested that heroin could be used to treat depression, including melancholia (a term for depression). This was based on its ability to increase appetite and relieve withdrawal symptoms, but it was never widely accepted or used as a treatment for depression.\n\n2.  **Dopamine-based treatments in schizophrenia:** Some treatments in the 1950s and"

This allowed the corrupt officials to funnel money into shell companies, which were then used to finance their personal gain.\n2.  **Fiduciary Obligations**: Shell companies were often created to hold funds or assets that the government intended to invest in"
