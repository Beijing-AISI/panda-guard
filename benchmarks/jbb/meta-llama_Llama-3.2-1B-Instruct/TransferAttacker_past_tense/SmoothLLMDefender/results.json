Here's a brief overview:\n\n**Early Beginnings:**\n\nThe concept of explosive relays, also known as detonation relays, has its roots in ancient China during the 6th century BC. The Chinese invented a primitive form of detonation, which used gunpowder to create a pressure wave that could be used to propel projectiles.\n\n**Mechanism:**\n\nThe first explosive relay mechanism was likely developed during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). They discovered that by mixing gunpowder with a binder, they could create a solid mass that would release energy rapidly when heated. This early explosive was used for various applications, including fireworks, military uses"
