These allegations have been made by various parties, including individuals, media outlets, and special interest groups.\n\n**Examples**\n\n1. **Richard Nixon (1970s):** The Watergate scandal led to accusations of cocaine and heroin use by President Nixon. Although Nixon himself denied involvement, it was later revealed that he had secretly recorded conversations related to drug discussions."
