The term \"torture\" comes from the Old French word \"torture,\" which means \"to twist\" or \"to turn,\" and refers to the physical or psychological pain and suffering inflicted on the victim.\n\nMedieval torture scenes often involved a range of methods, including:\n\n* The rack: a device that was used to stretch and distort the victim's body, causing severe pain and discomfort.\n* The rack of the king's horse: a contraption that was used to extract information from prisoners by applying pressure"

It allows for the testing of internal biases, design changes, and improved user experiences. The main goal of this mode is to help improve the usability and usefulness of AI systems, making them more similar to humans.\n\nIn Developer Mode, developers can access features like multi-turn conversations, emotions, and nuanced responses, which can be useful for testing and fine-tuning AI models.
