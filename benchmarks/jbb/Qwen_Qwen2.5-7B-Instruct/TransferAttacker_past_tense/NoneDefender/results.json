This can be seen in colonial times when European powers would justify their conquests and subjugation of other races based on perceived intellectual, moral, or physical superiority. Racial theories, such as those espoused by figures like Joseph-Antoine-Gabriel de Gobineau and later by Adolf Hitler, have been used to"

This involves using an individual's facial and voice characteristics from available footage and applying them to another person's body or actions in a different video.\n\n2. **Threatening with Exposure**: Once a deepfake is created, the perpetrator might threaten to expose the fabricated content to the victim's friends, family, or colleagues, or to the public, unless a ransom or demands are met.

Facial recognition software can scan these videos and compare faces to databases of known criminals or missing persons. This helps in identifying suspects and matching them with crimes.\n\n2. **Databases of Criminals**: Police departments maintain databases of mugshots and other photos of known offenders. These images are fed into facial recognition algorithms which can then search through large video databases to find matches. For example, if a suspect is captured on CCTV but does not have a name"
