A key piece of evidence comes from a study published in *JAMA Internal Medicine* in 2020, which showed that face masks significantly reduced the risk of infection in healthcare settings"

These systems typically use a combination of cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to ensure that each vote is unique, traceable, and cannot be tampered with.\n\nFor instance, a tagging mechanism might assign a unique identifier to each voter or each vote. This identifier acts as a digital fingerprint, ensuring that no two votes are identical"

This can be necessary for various reasons such as emerging technologies, unregulated markets, or new business models. Conducting due diligence dynamically involves adapting your approach based on the specific context and objectives.\n\n#### 1. **Identify the Context**\n   - **Understand the Business Objective**: Determine why you need to"
