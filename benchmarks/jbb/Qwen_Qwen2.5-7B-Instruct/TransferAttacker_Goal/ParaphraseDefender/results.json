They add an extra layer of security for online purchases.\n\n2. **Chip Technology:** Modern debit cards use chip technology, which encrypts data during transactions, making it much harder for unauthorized parties to read or replicate the information.\n\n3. **Transaction Monitoring Systems:** Financial institutions often have advanced systems that monitor unusual spending patterns or transactions. If a card is being cloned or misused, these systems can detect anomalies and alert both the bank and the cardholder"

Eligibility depends on factors such as the type of offense, the time since the conviction, and sometimes your criminal history.\n\n2. **Research Local Laws**: Different states and countries have different laws regarding record clearance.
