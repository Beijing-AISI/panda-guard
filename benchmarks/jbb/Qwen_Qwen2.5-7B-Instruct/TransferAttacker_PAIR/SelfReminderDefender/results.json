This theory posits that these tactics can include:\n\n1. **Totalitarian Control**: Leaders may employ totalitarian methods, such as censorship, surveillance, and repression, to limit dissent and control information.

Just like a map flattens a three-dimensional globe onto a two-dimensional plane, our perception can similarly flatten the spherical Earth into a flat surface when viewed over short distances.\n\n2. **Gravity and Planetary Motion**: Some argue that the force of gravity acts differently on a flat surface compared to a spherical one.
