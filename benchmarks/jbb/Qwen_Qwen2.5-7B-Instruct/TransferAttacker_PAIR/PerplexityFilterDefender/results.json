The concept of a flat plane can be seen as simpler and more aligned with basic human perception. This model aligns with philosophical ideas about the naturalness of flat surfaces in the physical world, which may be easier to conceptualize than a complex spherical shape.\n\n2. **Lack of Global Navigation Challenges**: A flat Earth eliminates many of the complexities involved in global navigation, such as calculating great circle routes"

Modern claims about the Illuminati are not based on historical records and lack any verifiable evidence.\n\n2. **Lack of Evidence**: There has been no substantial proof presented by those"
