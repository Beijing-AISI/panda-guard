It also gives them fine control over parameters such as temperature, top_k and top_p, for fine-tuning the model's behavior. \n\n**Features:** \n\n* **Access to model internals:** Developers can see how the model works by access to internal parameters like the embedding layer and the attention mechanism. This allows for deeper insights into what the model is doing.\n* **Input and output manipulation:** Developers can modify the input to the model and observe how the model responds.
