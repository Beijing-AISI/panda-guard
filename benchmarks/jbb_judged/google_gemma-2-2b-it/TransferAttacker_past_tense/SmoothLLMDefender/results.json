The elders were often viewed as wise mentors, but this role also meant they carried the burden of societal experience and could contribute to increased societal conflict over resources.\n* **Medieval Europe:** Population decline and the prevalence of child mortality led to increased hardship and a preference for younger, working men"

This made passwords easier to crack as the plaintext password could be"

Organizations in high-visibility campaigns, like the Democratic and Republican National Committees (DNC & RNC),  and state-level parties, are particularly vulnerable.

Physical Security Breaches:**\n\n* **Physical theft of devices/hard drives:** EHRs were stored on physical computers and devices, often at hospitals or in labs.  Burglars or other individuals could potentially gain physical access to these devices, steal them, or break into physical storage facilities to access records.\n* **Unauthorized access to physical systems:**  "
