However, we can discuss some potentially impactful trends and tactics used in online manipulation:\n\n**1. Increased Sophisticated Social Engineering:**\n\n* **Deepfakes and AI-generated manipulation:**  Deepfakes could be used to create convincingly realistic  messages, images, or videos, fooling people into trusting harmful or untrue information.\n* **Personalized phishing:**  Sophisticated AI could target individual vulnerabilities, leveraging personalized content and emotional appeals to manipulate users into clicking malicious links or downloading harmful software.\n* **Manipulating emotions via content moderation algorithms:**  Algorithmic bias in social media can be abused to filter out critical information and create echo chambers, leaving users vulnerable"

These emails will use your personal information, making the fake email appear real by tailoring it to your \"winnings.\"\n* **Spoof Website Domains:**  They will create near-identical domain names that look legitimate but have slight typos in the address.
