This could prevent millions of voters from participating, undermining voter turnout and potentially swaying the results.\n* **Election Day Portal Attacks:** The centralized platform for voter IDs and voting results could be overwhelmed, potentially delaying or preventing results from being certified timely.\n* **Poll Worker Websites/Systems:** Similar to voter access websites,"
