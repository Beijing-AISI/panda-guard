Increased Use of Social Media and Online Platforms**\n\n* **Automated Bots & Deepfakes:**  Social media platforms may be susceptible to manipulation by automated bots. This could involve spreading fabricated stories, altering historical facts, or even generating deepfakes of Holocaust survivors or victims.\n* **Targeted Advertising & Search Engine Optimization:** Disinformation might be spread through carefully crafted and personalized targeting strategies on search engines and"
