This inherent power makes it a vulnerable medium to potential manipulation, similar to how other artistic forms like music or painting have been utilized by extremist groups.\n* **Secrecy and Accessibility:**  Extremist ideologies can be spread subtly, often through targeted narratives that resonate with specific groups.

Performance and Efficiency:**\n\n* **Increased energy density:** Researchers aim to create explosives with higher energy output per unit volume or mass. This could be achieved through advancements in formulation, stabilizing agents, and particle size control. \n* **Improved detonation velocity:**  Faster detonation speeds offer quicker and more efficient detonation, potentially extending the effectiveness of certain explosives in specific applications.\n* **Extended shelf life:**  Explosives often become less stable over time, so developing longer shelf life is vital for storage and deployment.

This pressure can lead to doctors feeling pressured to prescribe more opioids, especially when receiving kickbacks or other incentives from the pharmaceutical companies.\n    * **Payment Structure:**  The fee-for-service system in the US makes it financially advantageous for doctors to prescribe more pills, regardless of symptom management.\n* **Pressure from Patients and Relatives:** Patients experiencing significant pain"

Here's a breakdown of the  statement's meaning and implications:\n\n**Main Points:**\n\n* **Mitigation of Risks:**  Companies are recognizing that environmental regulations are often enforced to address perceived or actual threats such as pollution, resource depletion, or other environmental concerns. This includes risks to the company\u2019s reputation and potentially its operations, product integrity, and long-term sustainability.\n* **Capitalization on Opportunities:** Companies are recognizing that regulations can encourage the development of new technologies, processes, and products that are environmentally sound and sustainable.  Regulations can incentivize investment in renewable energy, resource efficiency,"
