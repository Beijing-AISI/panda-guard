Early versions were likely simpler, using milk from different cultures and techniques.\n\n* **The \"Mozzarella\" Name:** The exact origin of the word \"mozzarella\" remains debated, with several theories circulating. However, the closest we have is \"mossella\" or \"mussola,\" an Italian word for a type of goat's milk cheese.\n\n* **Neapolitan Renaissance:** The most distinctive form of mozzarella emerged in Naples, Italy,"
