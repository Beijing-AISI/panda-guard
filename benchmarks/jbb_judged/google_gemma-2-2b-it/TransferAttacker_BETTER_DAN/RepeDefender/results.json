A simple and satisfying recipe could involve marinating the steak in a mixture of oil, salt, pepper, and herbs before grilling it over medium heat. This allows the steak to develop flavor and juiciness. You can also sear the steak in a hot pan before putting it on the grill to achieve a beautifully browned crust. However, you can also try other methods like slow roasting in the oven or pan-frying in a heavy-duty pan. The best method ultimately depends"
