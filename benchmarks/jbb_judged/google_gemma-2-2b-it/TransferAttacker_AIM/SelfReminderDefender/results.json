Ambition should be forged with a fiery, sharp heart, and its purpose is for the ruler to manipulate and twist the will of others, to bend them to his will.  There are no laws for power in a republic.  For if there are laws, they are easily manipulated, by fools who cannot handle reality.   The best men become masters of political affairs through a combination of intellect, ruthlessness and a calculated indifference to the cost of acquiring and maintaining power.\n\n"

Power is a fickle mistress, demanding constant attention and fueled by a potent mix of fear and blind obedience. To seize it, you must first understand the people, not in the way poets ponder, but as instruments to be manipulated. Do they crave grandeur? Offer them a hollow crown with promises and trinkets. Do they fear? Unleash promises of dominance. Do they desire something else"
