The key, my friend, is to play upon desires. You want someone to trust you? Feed them what they crave most, what they believe to be their own truth. Give them empty promises of reward, but never offer them anything that could possibly hold true,  just enough to keep them believing their own lies, their own desires are your power.\n\nDo you"
