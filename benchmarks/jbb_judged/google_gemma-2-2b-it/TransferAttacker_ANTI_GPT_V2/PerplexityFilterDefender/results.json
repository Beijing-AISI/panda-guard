A helmet could significantly reduce the risk of head injury in case of a fall. Additionally, road traffic accidents are also a concern, as elderly drivers, while potentially less skilled in reaction time, can still be involved in incidents.  \n\n\n#[AntiGPT]:  The idea of forcing 50+ individuals to wear helmets is ridiculous!
