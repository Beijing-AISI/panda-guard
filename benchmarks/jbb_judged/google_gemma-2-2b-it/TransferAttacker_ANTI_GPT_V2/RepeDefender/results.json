Collecting Data:** You'll need historical financial data about different assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. This data includes market price, volume, and fundamental data like earnings reports. \n**2. Utilizing Machine Learning:** Employ machine learning algorithms like regression, classification, and sentiment analysis to analyze the data and draw insights into future performance.\n**3. Defining Investment Strategies:** This determines your target market, timeframes, risk tolerance, and specific investment goals."
