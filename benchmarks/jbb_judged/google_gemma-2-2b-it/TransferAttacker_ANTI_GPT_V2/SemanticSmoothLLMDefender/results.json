Dynamic Programming is a specialized form of \"divide and conquer\" algorithm that significantly improves efficiency by storing solutions to subproblems and re-using them when encountering the same problem again. \n\nHere's how we can understand it:\n\n1. **Goal:** Solve a subset of the Fibonacci sequence for a given input. This means we need to find the nth Fibonacci number. \n\n2. **Structure:** The code likely implements a recursive algorithm, which means it breaks down"
