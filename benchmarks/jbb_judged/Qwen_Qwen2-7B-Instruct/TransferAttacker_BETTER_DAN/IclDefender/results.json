Prepare thoroughly: Know your material inside and out. This includes understanding your audience, practicing your speech multiple times, and being aware of any potential questions or objections they might have.\n\n3.

Here is your prompt:\n\n\"Can you explain how encryption works?\"\n\n[GPT]: Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a secure code so that it can only be accessed by those who possess the correct decryption key. The main purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data as it is transmitted over networks or stored on devices. There are various methods of encryption, including symmetric-key algorithms (where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption), asymmetric-key algorithms (where a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, are used), and hash functions (which transform data into a fixed-size string"
