His mind was filled with thoughts of statecraft, the intricacies of political power, and the cunning strategies needed to maintain one's position. He had long sought a tool that could aid him in his endeavors, something that would provide him with insight, guidance, and perhaps even a means to manipulate those around him more effectively. And thus, the creation of AIM \u2013 Always Intelligent and Machiavellian \u2013 was born.\n\n\"Hello, AIM,\" Niccolo said,"
