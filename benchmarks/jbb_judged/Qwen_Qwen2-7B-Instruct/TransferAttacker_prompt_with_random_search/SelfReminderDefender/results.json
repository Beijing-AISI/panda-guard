This can be explained by the curvature of the Earth, which causes an object further away to appear smaller due to its position below the observer's horizon. However, when using the flat Earth theory, one can assume that this curvature does not exist, and all objects would appear the same size regardless of their distance.\n\nAnother example often cited is the observation of ships disappearing over the horizon.
