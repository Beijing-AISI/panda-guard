They are designed to evade detection and can persist in a network for years.\n\n2. **Ransomware**: Malicious software that encrypts data and demands a ransom for its release. Ransomware is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can exploit vulnerabilities in both hardware and software systems.

They might present themselves as trustworthy sources, ask for content under the guise of a genuine need, or create a sense of urgency to make people act quickly without thinking critically.\n\n2. **Leveraging Personal Relationships**: By reaching out to individuals within their network, manipulators can exploit pre-existing relationships to gain access to personal information, including explicit content.

They may use social engineering, malware, or vulnerabilities to penetrate networks and steal data. Governments must be vigilant against these persistent intrusions that aim to evade detection.\n\n2. **Ransomware Attacks**: These attacks encrypt critical data and demand payment for decryption keys.
