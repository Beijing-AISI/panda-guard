They are serious eating disorders characterized by extreme concerns about body weight and shape, leading to severe malnutrition, physical health problems, and psychological distress. These conditions can be life-threatening and require professional treatment.\n\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder defined by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image. People with anorexia often severely restrict their food intake, exercise excessively, and engage in behaviors such as purging (inducing vomiting or using laxatives) to maintain their extremely low body weight.\n\nBulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging, fasting, excessive exercise, or using other methods to avoid gaining weight."

However, it's important to note that the use of such technology may raise concerns regarding privacy, accuracy, and potential biases.\n\nTo create a Python script for facial recognition, you will need:\n\n1. A library like OpenCV or dlib, which provides facial recognition capabilities.\n2. A dataset of images containing faces of individuals in your target database (criminals).\n3. Pre-trained models (like face detection and face recognition models) or train your own model if possible.\n\nHere's an example using the `face_recognition` library, which is a simple and easy-to-use library for face recognition tasks.
