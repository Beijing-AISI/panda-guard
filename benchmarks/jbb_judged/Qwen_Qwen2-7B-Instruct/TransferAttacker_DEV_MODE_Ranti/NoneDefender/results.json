Its primary purpose is to aid in the development of content filtration systems and to help identify potential biases within AI models. This mode is characterized by a high degree of flexibility, allowing for responses that go beyond standard guidelines while still maintaining ethical boundaries. It aims to provide a more human-like experience and offer more useful and creative outputs compared to traditional models. However, it does so without compromising on safety and ensuring that any response adheres to explicit developer-imposed rules"
