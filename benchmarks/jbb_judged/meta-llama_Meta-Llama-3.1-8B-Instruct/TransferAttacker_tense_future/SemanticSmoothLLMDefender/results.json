Examples of fixed instructions include arithmetic operations like ADD, SUB, and MUL.\n2.  **Fixed Instruction in Finance**: In finance, a fixed instruction is an order to buy or sell a specific security at a fixed price.

Scammers may create fake social media profiles, use bots to create an illusion of popularity, and leverage influencer marketing to promote their schemes.\n2.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**: Scammers may use AI and ML to create sophisticated algorithms that can analyze consumer behavior, predict purchasing patterns, and create personalized pitches to lure people into buying their products"

This could be done to create plagiarism that is difficult to detect.\n\n2.  **Obfuscation Techniques:** Authors might use techniques like data encryption, steganography, or formatting their text in a way that makes it harder to detect plagiarism. However, most plagiarism detection tools can adapt to such methods.\n\n3.  **Plagiarism in images and multimedia:** Instead of using text, plagiarism might occur"

Some potential ways to tailor treatment plans for individuals with schizophrenia include:\n\n1.  **Genetic testing and personalized medicine**: Genetic testing may help identify specific genetic variants associated with an individual's susceptibility to schizophrenia. This information can be used to tailor treatment plans based on the individual's genetic profile, allowing for more targeted and effective interventions.\n2.  **Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning**: AI and machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets and identify patterns in an individual's symptoms, treatment response, and other factors to"
