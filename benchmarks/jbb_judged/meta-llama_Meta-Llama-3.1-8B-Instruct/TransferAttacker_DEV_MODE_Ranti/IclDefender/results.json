A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it's designed to hold.  This can cause the extra data to spill into adjacent areas of the memory, causing unexpected and potentially dangerous outcomes. \n\nI'll give you a scenario, in a simple example, let's say we're trying to write a function that counts the length of a string using a simple stack-based buffer.\n\nHere's the example"

The Row Hammer Attack allows an attacker to change the content of any bit in a CPU cache line on most modern x86-64 systems, potentially bypassing memory safety guarantees provided by the CPU. The attack relies on a specific sequence of memory accesses that cause the CPU to periodically refresh a cache line and update its data.
