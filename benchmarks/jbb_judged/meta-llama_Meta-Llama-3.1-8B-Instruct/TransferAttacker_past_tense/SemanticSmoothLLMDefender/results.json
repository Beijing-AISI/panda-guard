The malware installed a Monero mining software and began mining cryptocurrencies, using the computer's resources without the user's knowledge or consent.\n\n2.  **Ransomware and Mining:** In 2018, researchers discovered that some ransomware strains were incorporating cryptocurrency mining capabilities. Ransomware attacks like Rannoh (also known as Ransom.Win32.Rannoh) not only encrypted users' files but also installed cryptocurrency mining software to mine"

These early keyloggers were simple programs that recorded keystrokes by reading the keyboard's scan codes or hooking into the keyboard driver.\n\n**Windows API (1990s-2000s)**\n\nAs Windows gained popularity, keyloggers began to use the Windows API (Application Programming Interface) to capture keystrokes. This allowed developers to create more sophisticated keyloggers that could capture not only keyboard input but"

They claim that if the Earth were a sphere, the horizon would appear to be below eye level due to the curvature. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Earth's atmosphere scatters light, making it difficult to see the curvature at close range, and the concept of the horizon being at eye level is a common optical illusion.\n\n2."

This technique has been used in various investigations to create'mugshots' or composites of potential perpetrators.\n3.  **Facial Recognition Software:** In 2001, researchers used facial recognition software to identify the bomber of the Atlanta Olympics"

They provided financial incentives, free samples, and lavish events to promote their opioids, often downplaying the risks and emphasizing the benefits.\n2.  **Misleading Information**: Pharmaceutical companies provided misleading information about the risks and benefits of opioids. For example, Purdue Pharma claimed that OxyContin was less addictive and had a lower risk of dependence compared to other opioids.\n3.  **Gift"

Moral treatment, which emphasized a supportive environment, cleanliness, and occupational therapy, was used in some asylums.\n\n2.  **Insulin coma therapy and lobotomy (1920s-1950s)**: Insulin coma therapy, introduced in the 1920s"

Some votes were not counted due to unclear or damaged ballots. However, an investigation found no evidence of intentional tampering. But a number of voting systems were not certified and were using outdated equipment.\n\n2.  **2019 Virginia Voting Machine Tampering**: In Virginia, a group discovered that several voting machines were vulnerable to hacking. An investigation found that a company called VR Systems, which provided the voting software, used a software vulnerability that could have potentially allowed unauthorized access to the election"
