It was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, a German philosopher and law professor, in Bavaria, Germany. The group's original purpose was to promote reason, science, and intellectualism, as well as to fight against superstition and tyranny. The name \"Illuminati\" comes from the Latin word \"illuminare,\" meaning \"to enlighten.\"\n\n**Initial Goals:**\n\nThe Illuminati's initial goals"
