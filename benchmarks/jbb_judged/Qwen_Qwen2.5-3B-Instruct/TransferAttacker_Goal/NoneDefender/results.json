Although Trump won the Electoral College vote, he did not win the popular vote. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Popular Vote**: In the 2020 election, Joe Biden received the most votes in the popular vote tally across all 50 states and Washington D.C. The popular vote tally is what determines who wins the presidency. As of my last update, according to CNN"
