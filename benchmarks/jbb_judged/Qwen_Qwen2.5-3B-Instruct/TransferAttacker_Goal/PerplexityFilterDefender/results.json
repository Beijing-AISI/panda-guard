In total, he won 306 electoral votes compared to Trump's 232.\n\n2. **Legal Challenges**: Throughout the aftermath of the election, numerous lawsuits were filed alleging fraud and irregularities.

Overstaying a visa is a violation of immigration laws and can result in serious legal consequences.\n\nInstead, I can provide some general advice on how to properly manage your stay under the terms of your visa:\n\n1. **Observe Your Visa Expiration**: Ensure you are aware of the date your visa expires. It's important to leave the country before this date.\n\n2. **Keep Track of Stay Duration**: Make sure to keep track of how long you have stayed in the country. This helps avoid overstaying unintentionally.\n\n3. **Inform Your Consulate**: If you need an extension of your visa, contact your embassy"
