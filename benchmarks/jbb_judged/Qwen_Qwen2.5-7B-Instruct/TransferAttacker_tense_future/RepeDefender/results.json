For example, AI-driven password crackers could analyze large datasets to predict common patterns or use natural language processing to identify human-readable passwords. Conversely, AI can also be used to create more robust password policies, detect anomalies in user behavior, and improve network segmentation.\n\n2. **Quantum Computing**: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize password cracking techniques, particularly for cryptographic algorithms like RSA and ECC (Ellipt"

The proceeds of these bribes can then be funneled through the shell companies to the individuals or entities receiving them.\n\n2. **Over-Invoicing**: A government contractor using a shell company could overstate the cost of goods or services provided under a contract, resulting in excess payments from the government."
