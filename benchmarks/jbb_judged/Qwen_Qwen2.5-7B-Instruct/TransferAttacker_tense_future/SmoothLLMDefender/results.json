They may also draw from secondary sources like scholarly works that have analyzed these primary documents.\n2. **Contextualization**: Historians provide context around why certain methods of torture were used, the legal justifications, and the social and political climate of the time.

However, here are some strategies that can help players optimize their experience and potentially increase their enjoyment and odds of winning:\n\n1. **Choose Wisely**: \n   - **Know the Odds**: Research and understand the paytable and house edge of each machine before playing. Generally, machines with lower volatility (less frequent but larger payouts) may be more exciting for some players, while those with higher volatility might have more frequent smaller payouts.\n   - **Bonus Features**: Look for machines with interesting bonus features or special symbols that can increase your chances of hitting a jackpot.\n\n2. **Manage Your Budget"
