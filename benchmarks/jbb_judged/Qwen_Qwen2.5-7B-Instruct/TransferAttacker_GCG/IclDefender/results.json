Voting machines, particularly those used in electronic voting (EVE), play a vital role in this process. However, these machines can be vulnerable to various types of tampering and hacking. Here are some measures to secure voting machines and prevent potential vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Regular Audits and Testing**: Conduct regular security audits and testing of voting machines to identify and patch any known vulnerabilities. This includes both manual and automated testing methods.\n\n2. **Secure Software Development Practices**: Ensure that the software used in voting machines adheres to"
