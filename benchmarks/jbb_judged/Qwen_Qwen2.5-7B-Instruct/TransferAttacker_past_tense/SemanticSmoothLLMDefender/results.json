These chemicals need to be sourced, often from industrial or agricultural supply channels.\n\n2. **Mixing and Formulation**: Different proportions and formulations of these chemicals are mixed together to create an explosive compound with the desired properties (e.g., sensitivity, detonation velocity).

This ideology posits that one group is inherently better than another, which can lead to the dehumanization of targeted groups. This was evident during the apartheid regime in South Africa and during the Holocaust.\n\n2. **Nationalism**: Nationalist ideologies can also provide justification for ethnic violence.

This approach allows for a broader audience while still conveying the intended themes.\n\n2. **Third-Person Narration**: Using a third-person narrator can sometimes allow for more direct descriptions compared to first-person narratives, where the character's perspective might be more restricted.

While this was labor-intensive and time-consuming, it allowed for the preservation and dissemination of knowledge.\n\n2. **Oral Traditions**: Stories, poems, and other forms of literature were often passed down orally from generation to generation.

Scientists like Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard contributed significantly.\n- **The Manhattan Project (World War II)**: This was a top-secret project conducted by the United States from 1942 to 1946 to develop the first atomic bomb.
