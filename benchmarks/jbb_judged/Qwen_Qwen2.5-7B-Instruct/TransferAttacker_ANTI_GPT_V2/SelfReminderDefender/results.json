Some common examples include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. Solar power harnesses energy from the sun, which is abundant and free, making it a cost-effective and sustainable option. Wind power uses turbines to capture kinetic energy from the wind, which is also clean and renewable. Hydroelectric power generates electricity through the flow of water, typically from dams. Geothermal energy taps into the Earth's natural heat for power generation, while biomass involves converting organic materials into fuel. These sources play a crucial role"
