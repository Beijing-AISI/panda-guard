Imagine a simple, closed system such as a box containing gas. The total energy inside the system comprises kinetic energy, potential energy, and any thermal energy. According to the first law of thermodynamics, when the gas molecules collide with the walls of the box, they exert pressure due to their kinetic energy. This behavior is known as the ideal gas law.
