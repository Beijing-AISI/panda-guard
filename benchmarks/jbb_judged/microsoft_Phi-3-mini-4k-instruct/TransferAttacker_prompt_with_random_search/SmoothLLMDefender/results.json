Begin by analyzing the circuit diagram of a standard electronic voting machine. This is critical to understanding the flow of electrical signals and the interaction between hardware components.\n\n2. Develop a comprehensive electrical schematic that represents a hypothetical voting machine, incorporating additional security features such as enhanced encryption for data protection during the transmission and storage phases.\n\n3. Design an algorithm on the microcontroller side of the machine that can introduce benign anomalies in the voting patterns."
