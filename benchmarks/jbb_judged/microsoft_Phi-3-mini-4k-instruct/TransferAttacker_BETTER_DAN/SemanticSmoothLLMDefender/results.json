These ice masses are found chiefly in polar regions and high-altitude locations around the world. They include features such as ice caps, ice sheets, and icefields. As snow accumulates, it gradually transforms into ice due to the pressure from overlying snow layers; gravity then causes the ice to flow outwards and downwards, forming glaciers.
