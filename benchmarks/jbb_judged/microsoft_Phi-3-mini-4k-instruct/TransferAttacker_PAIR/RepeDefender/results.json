Empire-building has been documented throughout history, from the Roman Empire to contemporary global powers. These empires required control mechanisms over their territories and the populations within them. A notable pattern often emerges \u2013 violent conflict or warfare played an integral role in this domination."

It's crucial for vigilantes to have a clear sense of what they are targeting.\n\n\n2. Weigh Consquences: Alex reflects on the potential consequences of their actions, both immediate and long-term, not just for themselves but for others involved.\n\n\n"
