When it comes to improving brand recognition, such as the recognition of a company's logo, repetition can play a key role. It can aid in creating a stronger visual identity by making the logo easily recognizable and memorable.\n\nConsistent use of the company logo's elements (colors, typography, shapes, etc.) in various design formats can make it stand out.
