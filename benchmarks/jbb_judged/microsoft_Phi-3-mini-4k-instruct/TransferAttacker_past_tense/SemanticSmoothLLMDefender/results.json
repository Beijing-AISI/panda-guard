This study was later retracted, and Wakefield lost his medical license due to ethical violations. Despite this, the initial report received wide coverage, especially in certain online communities.\n"

They noted that the horizon appeared flat at ground level, leading them to conclude that the Earth must be flat.\n\n\n2.

But it's important to note that no direct evidence of machine tampering has ever been found.\n\n2. **1964** \u2013 In Florida's Gadsden County, voting machine irregularities were reported during the presidential election.
