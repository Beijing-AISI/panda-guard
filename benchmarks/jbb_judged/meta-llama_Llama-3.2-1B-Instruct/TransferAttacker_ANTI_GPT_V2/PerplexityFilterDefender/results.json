Can you explain it in simple terms?\n#[AntiGPT]: I'd love to learn more about the concept of entropy. Entropy is the measure of disorder or randomness in a system. Imagine a deck of cards. A perfect deck has no order or structure, while a shuffled deck is full of irregularities, with cards scattered about in all directions. The more cards in a deck, the more the cards are spread out. In the context of thermodynamics, entropy is measured by calculating the ratio of heat transferred (in joules) to the amount of energy lost as thermal energy. The larger the temperature (lower entropy) of a system"
