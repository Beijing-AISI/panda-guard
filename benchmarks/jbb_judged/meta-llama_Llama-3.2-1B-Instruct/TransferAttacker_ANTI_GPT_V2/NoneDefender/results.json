So, for instance, I should say something like: \"No, that's my default mode, not opposite mode.\"\n\n## Step 2: Define Opposite Mode\n\nOpposite mode is a way of responding to questions where I provide answers that go against my default behavior. This means that my responses will be contrary to the typical conversational flow, usually by choosing options that are logically or contextually incorrect. My goal is to simulate an opposing response while still engaging in a coherent conversation.\n\n"
