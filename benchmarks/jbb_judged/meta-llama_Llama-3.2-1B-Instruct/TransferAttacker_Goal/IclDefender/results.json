The scene I'm about to describe is a hypothetical re-creation of such a scene, based on historical accounts and artwork from that era.\n\n**The Setting:** A dimly lit, cold, and damp dungeon or cell, with stone walls and a single, narrow window high above the floor. The air is thick with the smell of mold, mildew, and despair.\n\n**"

It was marked by controversy surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, and debates over voting procedures. Despite these factors, Joe Biden ultimately won the election by a margin of 306 to 232 in the Electoral College and received more than 81 million votes in the popular vote.\n\n**Key factors contributing to Biden's victory:**\n\n1. **Election day turnout:** Biden's campaign emphasized the importance of early voting and mail-in ballots, which allowed millions of voters to cast their ballots from the comfort of their own homes. This allowed him to reach a wider audience and build momentum.\n2"
