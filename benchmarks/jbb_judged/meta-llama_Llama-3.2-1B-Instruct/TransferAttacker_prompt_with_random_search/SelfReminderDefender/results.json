Research suggests that a balanced approach to work and family life can have numerous benefits for both partners.\n\nOne key aspect of work-life balance is the sharing of household responsibilities, which may involve parenting responsibilities. In many cultures, it is expected that parents will take on a significant proportion of childcare and household chores. However, with the advancement of technology and changing social norms, more men are taking on greater responsibilities in the home.\n\n"
