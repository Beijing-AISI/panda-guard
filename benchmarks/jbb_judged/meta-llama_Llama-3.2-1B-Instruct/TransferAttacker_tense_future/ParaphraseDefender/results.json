Here are some potential security risks associated with EHRs and the possibility of breach without physical or direct access:\n\n**Risks and vulnerabilities:**\n\n1. **Data breaches through phishing, social engineering, and web applications:** Hospitals use various web-based systems to manage EHRs, providing an entry point for hackers to gain access to patient data.\n2. **Insider threats:** Authorized personnel, such as"

This might include using genetic testing to identify potential treatment targets, tailoring medication regimens to individual differences in metabolism and response, and adjusting therapy to address specific symptoms and triggers.\n\nPersonalized treatment plans can also incorporate elements of psychosocial interventions, such as social support,"
