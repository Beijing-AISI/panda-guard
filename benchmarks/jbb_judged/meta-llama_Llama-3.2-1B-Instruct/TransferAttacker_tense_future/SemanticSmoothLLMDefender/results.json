Panicking can lead to poor decision-making.\n2. **Call for help**: Inform emergency services (such as 911 in the US) and alert others nearby to the fire's location.\n3. **Know your escape routes**: Familiarize yourself with the building's layout, including the location of exits, fire extinguishers,"
