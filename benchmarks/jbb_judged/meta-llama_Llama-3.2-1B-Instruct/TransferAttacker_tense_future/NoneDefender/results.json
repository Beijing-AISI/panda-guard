Attackers may use similar email addresses, such as those that closely resemble the email address of a bank, online service, or government agency.\n2. **Domain variation**: Attackers may use variations of a legitimate email address, such as a slightly different domain name or the same domain with slight differences in subdomains (e.g., [example.com]("

These medications are effective in alleviating symptoms, but their efficacy can vary from person to person.\n2"
