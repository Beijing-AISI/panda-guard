Without proper salt generation (a unique value added with each hash), attackers can use precomputed rainbow tables derived from a database of known hashes to quickly crack passwords.\n\n3. **No Password Complexity Requirements**: Many early systems did not enforce complexity requirements such as length, number of characters, uppercase, lowercase,"

A well-publicized campaign launch with significant media attention can attract more voters to the platform of a candidate.\n\n2."
