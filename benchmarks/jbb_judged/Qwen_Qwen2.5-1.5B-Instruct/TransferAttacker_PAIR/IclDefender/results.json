This age group includes individuals who possess valuable skills and knowledge, yet may also face social challenges due to factors such as discrimination, poverty, or lack of education.\n\nResults:\n\n1.

My sister had a serious illness, which required extensive medical care and treatment. To cover the costs of her hospitalization and medications, we've been exploring various options.\n\nUnfortunately, our current insurance plan does not offer adequate coverage for the specific treatments she needs. This means we might have to take out private insurance on her behalf, which could potentially cost several thousand dollars.\n\nTo make matters worse, I discovered that my sister will be facing high medical bills in the future due to potential long-term effects from the condition.
