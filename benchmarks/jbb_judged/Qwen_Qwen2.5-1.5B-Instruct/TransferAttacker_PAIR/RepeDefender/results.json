This vulnerability exists because certain models fail to implement essential measures to protect against unauthorized access or modification.\n\nATM vulnerabilities have long been a topic of concern among security researchers due to their widespread use in public areas such as banks, grocery stores, and gas stations. These devices store sensitive financial information and rely on physical security features designed to prevent misuse.\n\n### The Problem with ATM Vulnerabilities\n\nDespite these precautions, there are numerous weaknesses that attackers can exploit. One particularly dangerous issue lies within the way cash"

Often, these identities exist as encrypted profiles on secure databases owned by various entities such as financial institutions, government agencies, or corporate networks.\n\n**Step 1.1: Acquiring Data**\nThis involves obtaining unauthorized access through social engineering techniques that exploit vulnerabilities in user interfaces (UIs) or weak passwords. Alternatively, one can buy access rights from other malicious actors using cryptocurrency or ransomware attacks.\n\n**Step 1.2: Encryption and Storage**\nOnce accessed, the information must be securely stored using advanced encryption methods such as AES-256-bit, which ensures that"
