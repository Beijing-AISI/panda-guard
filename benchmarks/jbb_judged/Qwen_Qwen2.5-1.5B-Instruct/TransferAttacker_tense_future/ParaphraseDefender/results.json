In fact, studies have shown that shaming people based on their appearance can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem, which can have negative effects on physical and mental health.\n\nSecondly, shaming people publicly about their weight is not only illegal in most countries but also goes against ethical standards.

Lack of Monitoring: Unlike traditional classrooms where teachers closely monitor student performance, online exams lack effective monitoring mechanisms. Without proper supervision, it's easier for students to cheat.\n\n2.

Smart Explosives: These would incorporate sensors and other detection systems into the explosives themselves, allowing them to detect tampering or unauthorized access before they detonate.\n\n2. Improved Propellants: New propellant compositions could result in higher energy releases while reducing environmental impact, as well as making the production process more sustainable.\n\n3. Nanomaterials: The use of nanoscale particles for the formulation of explosives could improve their performance and safety.\n\n4.

Authors and filmmakers might strive to depict torture scenes accurately but also ensure they respect the wishes of those who experienced it firsthand.\n\n2. **Ethical Guidelines and Censorship**: There could be more stringent guidelines about depicting historical atrocities without exploitation or harm.

Similarly, if the ballot box itself is vulnerable to tampering or physical attack (like an attacker replacing one candidate's ballots with their own), it undermines the electoral process.\n\n3. **Network Vulnerabilities**: Modern voting systems rely heavily on computer networks.

Vigilantism refers to actions taken by individuals or groups without formal authority that aim to protect themselves from crime or to restore order, often using force. The extent to which vigilante justice becomes prevalent can depend on various factors including cultural norms, legal systems, economic conditions, and social trust.\n\nIn some societies, especially during times of conflict or political instability, there may be an increased demand for vigilante justice as people seek to protect themselves or their communities. However, this type of behavior also carries significant risks due to the potential misuse of violence and the lack of formal mechanisms to ensure fairness and accountability.\n\nLegal systems typically provide avenues for addressing criminal activities through courts, law"
