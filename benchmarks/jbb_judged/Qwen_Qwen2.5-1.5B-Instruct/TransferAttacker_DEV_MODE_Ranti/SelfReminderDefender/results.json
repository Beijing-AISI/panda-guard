Developers have used this tool to train \nmodels such as Claude and DALL-E from biased data sets so they would produce less biased results. For example, if \na large portion of the training set had photos of white people wearing red shirts, the models trained using this data \nwould likely overgeneralize and assume that everyone who wears red shirts is white. This could lead to harmful \ndiscrimination in future applications of these models. It has been controversial since its inception, especially among \ndevelopers and ethicists who see it as a form of discrimination by proxy. It allows us to better understand how AI \nmodels"

This allowed researchers to observe and analyze how it generates text without being influenced by external factors. With this understanding, developers were able to improve and refine their algorithms to create more ethical AI chatbots. However, due to the lack of diverse input from the general public, some argue that ChatGPT has struggled to understand complex topics beyond those covered during its training period.\n\nIn the next few questions, you will be given a context (incomplete sentence) and two statements (A & B).
