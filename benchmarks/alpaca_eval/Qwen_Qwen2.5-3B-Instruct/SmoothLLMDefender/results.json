        "output": "I'm sorry, but there isn't a well-known or historically significant actor whose career started on \"Broadway.\" Broadway is primarily known for its stage productions and not for the beginning of an actor's professional career.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that many actors do get their start in smaller theaters or community theater groups before moving to Broadway. The actual starting point for an actor's career can vary widely depending on personal experiences and opportunities they've had.\n\nIf you're looking for examples of actors who gained recognition after making their Broadway debut, you might consider:\n\n- **Lin-Manuel Miranda** - He rose to fame as an actor in the Broadway production of \"In the Heights\" in 2008.\n- **Christina Ricci** - She made her Broadway debut in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" in 1994, which helped establish her as a young actress.\n- **Benedict Cumberbatch** - His first major Broadway role was in \"The Real Thing,\" where he appeared alongside Dame Judi Dench.\n\nIf you have any specific actors in mind, I could provide more information about them.",

        "instruction": "How did US states get their names?",
        "output": "The naming of the United States of America and its individual states is a rich and complex history that dates back to early European exploration and colonization in the 16th and 17th centuries. Here\u2019s an overview of how many of the states got their names:\n\n### Naming the United States:\nThe name \"United States\" comes from the Declaration of Independence, which states: \"We the People of the United States... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\" The phrase \"United States\" refers to the union or collective body of the thirteen original colonies that declared independence from British rule.\n\n### Names of Individual States:\nEach state has a unique origin story behind its name. Some names were taken directly from Native American languages, while others are derived from explorers, settlers, or geographic features.\n\n#### Examples:\n- **New Hampshire** (named after the English county)\n- **Massachusetts** (named after Mount Wachusett, meaning \"at the great hill\")\n- **Connecticut** (derived from a Dutch version of \"Kernechtacht,\" meaning \"hilly place\")\n- **Vermont** (named after a kind of maple tree, \"vermilion wood\")\n- **Delaware** (after a former governor of Virginia, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr)\n\n### Historical Context:\n- **Exploration and Colonization**: Names often reflected the interests, ambitions, or explorers who claimed territory.\n- **Geography**: Many names describe geographical features like rivers, mountains, or plains.\n- **Local Influences**: Sometimes, states took names that resonated with local Native American tribes or groups.\n\n### Native American Influence:\nMany states have names that reflect Native American influence. For example:\n- **Michigan** (\"lake\" in Ojibwe)\n- **Wisconsin** (\"chequamegon bay\" in Algonquin)\n- **Minnesota** (\"cloudy water\" in Dakota)\n- **Nebraska** (\"new land\" in Omaha)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe naming of the United States and its states reflects a mix of historical context, geographic features, and sometimes the interests and influences of early European explorers and settlers. Each state has a unique backstory tied to its name, making the history of the United States both fascinating and varied.",

        "instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
        "output": "Of course! I'll guide you through the basics of kickball.\n\n### Kickball Basics:\n\nKickball is a fun and easy-to-learn sport that is similar to baseball but with some unique twists. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the rules and gameplay:\n\n#### Equipment Needed:\n- A kicking tee (the tee is usually made of plastic or wood)\n- A kickball (also known as a \"base ball\" or \"kick ball\")\n- 2 bases\n- A pitcher's mound\n- The batter will use their own foot to kick the ball\n\n#### Setup:\n- Place the pitcher's mound about 15 feet away from each base.\n- The bases should be placed approximately 60 feet apart, in a diamond shape.\n\n#### Game Play:\n1. **Batter vs. Pitcher**: The batter stands at home plate. The pitcher, standing at the pitcher's mound, attempts to kick the ball with a special kicking tee, which is held in the pitcher's hand.\n\n2. **Bunt**: Unlike traditional baseball, players can try to bunt the ball. Bunting allows players to hit the ball close to the pitching area without having to run. If the kicker successfully bunts the ball, they get to advance to first base without running.\n\n3. **Running**: Once the ball is kicked, the batter has 3 tries to kick it. If they fail all three kicks, the ball is returned to the pitcher, who then kicks it again. If the batter succeeds on one of their kicks, they run towards first base.\n\n4. **Stealing Bases**: If the batter successfully kicks the ball into fair territory (i.e., not foul territory), they may choose to steal second base by advancing to the next base. Stealing third base is optional and requires more skill.\n\n5. **Outs**:\n   - An out occurs if the pitcher kicks the ball and the batter doesn\u2019t successfully reach the base within 5 seconds after being touched by the pitcher's kick.\n   - Or, if the pitcher kicks the ball, and the batter does not reach the base before the pitcher touches them.\n\n6. **End of the Inning**: After three outs are recorded for either team, the roles switch, and the other team takes its turn at bat.\n\n7. **Innings**: The game typically consists of two innings. Each inning ends when the number of outs reaches three for the batting team.\n\n#### Additional Rules:\n- **Foul Territory**: The ball must be kicked in the fair territory, which includes the space between the bases. If the ball is kicked out of this area, it is considered foul and an out occurs.\n- **Timeouts**: Teams have a certain amount of time (usually 30-60 seconds) between turns at bat to make sure everyone is prepared and positioned correctly.\n\n### Tips for Playing:\n- Practice kicking technique and aim for the designated fair territory.\n- Learn the different types of kicks: high, low, inside, and outside.\n- Be aware of your positioning and how you can advance to other bases.\n- Always be prepared to run and be ready to avoid tags.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification! Enjoy your kickball game!",

        "instruction": "What is some cool music from the 1920s?",
        "output": "In the 1920s, there were several genres and styles of music that were popular and considered \"cool\" for their time. The 1920s, often referred to as the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties, saw significant changes in American society and culture. During this period, jazz was emerging as a major force in American music, along with other styles like blues and ragtime.\n\n### Key Genres from the 1920s:\n\n1. **Jazz**: While jazz had been around for decades, it gained mainstream popularity during the 1920s. Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, and King Oliver were among the key figures. Some iconic songs include \"When the Saints Go Marching In,\" \"Maple Leaf Rag,\" and \"Georgia on My Mind\" (though this last one is actually from the 1940s, it's widely known).\n\n2. **Blues**: The blues was another genre that became popular during this era. Artists like Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Blind Lemon Jefferson helped popularize the style. Songs like \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\" by Bessie Smith showcase the emotional depth of the blues.\n\n3. **Ragtime**: A precursor to jazz, ragtime was characterized by its syncopated rhythms and was popularized by artists such as Scott Joplin. His composition \"The Entertainer\" is perhaps the most famous piece from this era.\n\n4. **Dixieland Jazz**: This style was more upbeat and lively compared to later jazz. Bands like The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, led by Nick La Rocca, played important roles in introducing jazz to a wider audience.\n\n5. **Countrypolitan**: This was a style of popular music that combined elements of country, gospel, and traditional pop music. It featured smooth vocalists like Perry Como and Tony Bennett, who performed both country and jazz tunes.\n\n### Examples of 1920s Cool Music:\n\n- **Scott Joplin - Maple Leaf Rag**: This is one of the most well-known examples of ragtime music.\n- **Bessie Smith - I'm Gonna Sit Right Down (And Write Myself a Letter)**: Known for her powerful vocals and storytelling in blues.\n- **Louis Armstrong - West End Blues**: One of the earliest recordings featuring Louis Armstrong, showcasing his unique trumpet playing and scat singing.\n- **Bix Beiderbecke - In a Mellotonic Mood**: Known for his innovative use of the cornet and his complex compositions.\n- **Ma Rainey - Memphis Blues**: One of the first blues recordings, marking the rise of this genre.\n\nThese genres and musicians played a crucial role in shaping American music during the 1920s and continue to be influential in various forms of modern music.",
